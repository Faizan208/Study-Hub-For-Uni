/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict authorization.
 * It uses an owner-based access control model for user-specific data and
 * restricts write access to admins for administrative content. Data shape
 * validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /admins/{adminId}: Stores admin profiles.
 * - /assignments/{assignmentId}: Stores assignment data.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quiz data.
 * - /practicals/{practicalId}: Stores practical data.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profiles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin profiles are only accessible by authenticated admins.
 * - Assignments, quizzes and practicals are writable only by admins.
 * - Users can only read and write their own profiles.
 * - List operations are restricted to owners for user-specific data.
 * - Open read access for assignments, quizzes and practicals.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Assignments include the `adminId` to directly authorize updates and deletions.
