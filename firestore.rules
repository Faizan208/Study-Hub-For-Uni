/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces role-based access control for admins and owner-only access for user profiles, and owner only access for assignment uploads.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /admins/{adminId}: Stores administrator profiles. Only accessible to authenticated admins.
 * - /assignments/{assignmentId}: Stores assignment details. Accessible to authenticated admins and read only for all users.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quiz details. Accessible to authenticated admins.
 * - /practicals/{practicalId}: Stores lab practical details. Accessible to authenticated admins.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public profiles for regular users. Users can only read and write their own profile.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Only authenticated admins can create, update, or delete assignments, quizzes and practicals.
 * - Regular users can only read their own profiles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Assignments store the 'adminId' of the uploader, allowing simple rule-based access control.
